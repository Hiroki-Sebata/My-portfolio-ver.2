                <h3>About Me</h3>
                <p><strong>I</strong> am a university student in Japan, Bachelor of engineering, Aerospace engineering. 
I have started taking programming seriously when I took one of my major class, connected with C++. the class made me to find a way to start of my developer career. Since then, I have taken two online courses, <a href="https://skillcrush.com/blueprint/front-end-development-course/?hsCtaTracking=2a523887-7bc2-47c8-a84a-0536313ec597%7Cba580d7a-656a-45ea-affc-fb135ebac3ad" target="_blank">Skillcrush</a>, <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/catalog" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. Both of them helped me to know more about what to do in my future career and be as a professional web developer. The languages I have been learning so far are <em>HTML, CSS, Javascript</em> and <em>Python</em>. Of course I do not have working experiences with those languages though, I want to develop my skills to be able to compete in web developer industry. Thus, I will keep learning and <strong>never give up</strong> on programming. 
Once I get hired and start working, I am sure that I will be <strong>competitive, motivated</strong> and catching up new informations every time. 
<br>Besides, I want to challenge my future career to be abroad so I decided to start job-hunting in Poland where my girlfriend lives in. It would be more difficult to find a work or work time to time. However, I will not give up easily and find a solution when I face some problems.</p>

                <h3><em>Why I like coding</em></h3>
                <p>As I mentioned in previous paragraph, when I started being excited about coding was when I was a junior grades of university. The most interesting part for me was when I code and hit run, the code I wrote ran perfectly as if I expected. Therefore, I was able to feel as if I achieve something special. Since then every time I hit run to my code, I cannot wait to see how those codes would run. Of course it is not going to be smooth all attempts but even while I am finding few mistakes in my code and fixed them, I am sure that I learned those mistakes from it. So I never thought making mistakes in coding is wasting my time. </p>
